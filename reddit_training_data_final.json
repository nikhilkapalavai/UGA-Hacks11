My gaming laptop keeps freezing, the graphics are terrible, the loading times are so long, and it's simply a pain to play Fortnite or create maps on it. I don't actually plan on playing any other games on the PC.\n\nMy budget isn't very high, but it's roughly between 800 and 1100\u20ac.\n\nI would be very happy with great high performance, very short loading times, and generally a powerful gaming PC for my use case. I don't need or want any extras like LEDs or other embellishments on the PC, it should simply do its job well.\n\nI dont have the time and motivation to build a PC, thats why I need a good prebuild gaming PC which is in my budget and matches my use case.\n\nI hope you can help me; I would be very, very grateful for your knowledge.\n\nWith kind regards, Turna",

It doesn't mean it's low end or high end. \n\nFor a gaming PC, the most important part is the graphics card. This is the part that actually does most of the work and creates everything you see. If you can't understand every spec, then at the very least make sure the PC has a good graphics card - because that's the most expensive and important component."

Time has now caught up however, and I get increasingly frustrated trying to run anything on it, and a growing desire to get back into gaming. The catch - I am completely lost, my knowledge from back then has not transferred well.\n\nMy budget is again \\~1000 euro, but my prelimenary research has stretched this upwards to about 1300. I am seemingly unable however, to put anything together that would perform somewhere near the standard that my build back in 2016 had. It seems like a pc of that level would now be much more expensive to build.\n\nI don't really care about the newest and fanciest stuff. I just would like to run new games (Cyberpunk, Red Dead, BG3) and older modded games (Skyrim, Fallout) without constantly running into performance issues. Just a smooth experience. For example: 1080p is what I am used to, and completely fine. I am not looking for improvement really, just to get back to the standard I was at about ten years ago. So high settings and framerate for newer stuff.\n\nI live in the Netherlands and am currently working of this guide: [https://tweakers.net/best-buy-guide/desktops/beste-1080p-game-pc](https://tweakers.net/best-buy-guide/desktops/beste-1080p-game-pc)\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated!",

I've built 4 PCs in my 40 years on this earth, so now my landlord/roommate/good friend comes to me for this stuff all the time (consulting and perhaps labor in exchange for rent discount) and honestly, it's been 3 years since the last one and I'm out of the loop.  He doesn't really take no for an answer (\"You're the only one I know who knows about this stuff, so who else am I gonna ask\", etc, and that's fine, I get it).\n\nHe has played LoL since the beginning of LoL (nearly daily at least 1 match) and pretty much nothing else, but I recently shared my steam library with him and encouraged him to branch out and he's enamored with StS.  I anticipate (and would like it) that his repertoire will eventually expand further (ulterior motive), but for now these are the two games he cares about (that, and to be able to easily clean it because of all of our pets and smoke).\n\nLoL will constantly evolve and get more resource intense, so I would like it to be at least a bit future proof in that regard.  Personally, I'm no expert, researching this stuff is quite intense for me but usually at the end of the journey I get a brand new PC (not the case here, so not nearly as motivated)... I build a $2000 PC to last me for 7-10 years, but he wants a bargain to last just a few, and that's not really my style, so any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nWindows 11, I suppose, but let's ignore acquisition of the OS for the purposes of budgeting for this.  He wants it closer to 300 range (so when in doubt, I guess go for the bargain), but can go as high as 500...  I don't even know if you can get a stick of ram for those prices these days, lol!  I mentioned that, and he told me he is not opposed to some type of refurb/used system as long as there is a good guarantee/warranty/return policy or something along those lines.  A new/used/refurb mini PC could also be an option if I frame properly (can't clean it as easily, but also attracts less dust to begin with).\n\nThere's a Microcenter within reach (Indy area)  \nWifi fine, but we can reach it with an ethernet cable  \nHis current monitor is fine... basic samsung 1080p I believe, nothing flashy, probably a lower refresh rate  \nStorage is not a huge concern, as our internet is fast and these games aren't huge.\n\n**TLDR Summary:**  \nBudget: **$300\u2013$500** (target **$300\u2013$400**, hard cap $500)  \nLocation: **USA**  \nPeripherals: **none needed** (tower only)  \nOS: **Windows 11** (exclude cost)\n\n**Games / target:**\n\n* League of Legends (priority)\n* Slay the Spire\n* 1080p, smooth gameplay, some headroom for future LoL updates / light new games\n\n**Preferences:**\n\n* Easy to clean (pets/smoke), so a case with dust filters/mesh is ideal\n* Refurb/used/prebuilt/mini is OK if the seller has strong warranty/returns\n* Size/Noise/Color/Lighting, all irrelevant\n\nIf you recommend a refurb/prebuilt instead of DIY, please include a few models/spec targets to search for.",

It would be based around a 5090 (probably the Gigabyte Aorus Master one, unless you change my mind on the brand/model)\n\nMy current config is [this one](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/kBrCkJ). On this same sub, I asked 8 months ago and got [this config](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sf7knp) from a kind fellow redditor.\n\nWhat do you think, is the suggested config still relevant ? Should some parts be changed given recent prices and product releases ?\n\nGiven the current RAM situation, I'm ready to bite the bullet if needed, otherwise I can wait a few months replaying HD2 on my current old config.\n\nBudget: 4k-5k\u20ac (no choice since 5090, could be even more idk)  \nRegion: Europe (France)  \nAesthetics: For the same price, I'd prefer less LED but not really important\n\n  \nThanks in advance !",

My old macbook is sadly lacking at 11 years old, and I want something i can upgrade in the future.\n\nI'm a digital creative and need something that can run Adobe CC for video and motion graphics with some Blender 3d work too.\n\nI've put something together on pcpartpicker\n\nhttps://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/7VRnmC#compatibility\\_notes\n\nAny thing I could do better with my budget? Any major cock ups? This will be my first build.",
        "completion": "Given your use case (Adobe CC for video editing and motion graphics - which I'm assuming means mostly Premiere and After Effects), I'd suggest you consider the Intel 265K instead of Ryzen for reasons I'll link below.\n\nAs for the costco pre-build, I don't think it's the best choice for your stated purposes. The 9800X3D is a great gaming CPU but not that good for the productivity tasks you've mentioned.  Also if you're going to be rendering in Blender, the 5070 Ti will serve you better than a 5070.\n\nSuggestions below that provide slightly better performance in Premiere and After Effects while plus some other minor improvements for a little less cost overall. Edit: Changed to a different model 5070 Ti that is actually in stock at the price listed, since the 5070 Ti in the original list is falsely advertised by awd-it as being in stock - it's not and is listed as \"coming soon\", which basically means they have no idea when it will be in stock.  Almost every listing at AWD-IT is misleading like that, with artificially low pricing.\n\n* **CPU**:  Normally I am a fan of Ryzen for gaming, but for your specific cases of video editing (Premiere) and motion graphics (After Effects) the Intel 200 series is the better choice for you.  The Intel 265K performs better than the 9900X in Premiere while being on par with in After Effects, all for less cost.\n   * See [these content creation benchmarks from Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-ultra-200s-content-creation-review/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-FXanT1vqqhW93Efew_R8ZJ1KJ-WG0l4irdsTxtxxtJpCGyqh) for comparative performance.\n   * While the AM5 platform gives you an option to upgrade, it looks like you tend to keep your computers for a long time (ex. 11 years on a Macbook).  If you keep your pc even 6 years, the upgrading is kind of a moot point as AMD will have released a new socket by then.\n* **CPU Cooler**:  Switched to an air cooler for better reliability.  It looks like you tend to keep your pc for a long time so an air cooler won't have any failure issues like an AIO will be more likely to have after 6+ years (mainly pump failure).\n   * The Scythe Mugen will be able to cool the 265K without issues even under multi-core load.  [This Hardware Canucks review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-8PZKcMYg) shows the Scythe Mugen 6 being one of the best coolers for Intel, keeping a 13900K under 72 C while running under Blender rendering at 180w load.  [This Techpowerup review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-ultra-7-265k/24.html) shows the 265K only drawing 155w under Blender multi-core rendering load.\n* **Memory**:  Adobe can be RAM intensive.  Switched to 48GB of RAM for more headroom. 64GB would be more ideal, but it's exorbitantly expensive.\n   * The RAM specs aren't ideal, but [Puget Systems' testing on DDR5 RAM speeds](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/impact-of-ddr5-speed-on-content-creation-performance-2023-update/?srsltid=AfmBOooarspWc6ATXjK02obCWpNytZJ4KsM3iQRuEM79BLaGjt1FGBXH) show minimal affect of RAM specs on performance of Intel CPU's in Premiere and After Effects.\n* **Storage**:  Switched to the much less expensive still good spec Crucial T500 (dram cache, good speeds, good endurance ratings).\n* **Power Supply**:  850w is plenty for the system.\n* **Case Fans**:  Added a 3-pack of 140mm PWM fans for intake airflow on the front of the case.\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/MW49jn)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [Intel Core Ultra 7 265K 3.9 GHz 20-Core Processor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/mBsV3C/intel-core-ultra-7-265k-39-ghz-20-core-processor-bx80768265k) | \u00a3262.27 @ Amazon UK \n**CPU Cooler** | [Scythe Mugen 6 60.29 CFM CPU Cooler](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/k6bRsY/scythe-mugen-6-6029-cfm-cpu-cooler-scmg-6000) | \u00a345.95 @ Amazon UK \n**Motherboard** | [MSI PRO Z890-A WIFI ATX LGA1851 Motherboard](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/ZvzXsY/msi-pro-z890-a-wifi-atx-lga1851-motherboard-pro-z890-a-wifi) | \u00a3227.91 @ Newegg UK \n**Memory** | [Crucial Pro 48 GB (2 x 24 GB) DDR5-5600 CL46 Memory](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/z6NYcf/crucial-pro-48-gb-2-x-24-gb-ddr5-5600-cl46-memory-cp2k24g56c46u5) | \u00a3465.77 @ Newegg UK \n**Storage** | [Crucial T500 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/GfRwrH/crucial-t500-1-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-ct1000t500ssd8) | \u00a3124.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Storage** | [Crucial T500 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/GfRwrH/crucial-t500-1-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-ct1000t500ssd8) | \u00a3124.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Video Card** | [Palit GamingPro-S GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/KzCCmG/palit-gamingpro-s-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16-gb-video-card-ne7507t019t2-gb2031u) | \u00a3803.94 @ CCL Computers \n**Case** | [Phanteks XT PRO ATX Mid Tower Case](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/zJWJ7P/phanteks-xt-pro-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-xt523p1-bk01) | \u00a353.99 @ AWD-IT \n**Power Supply** | [Montech CENTURY II 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/sqbypg/montech-century-ii-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-century-ii-850w) | \u00a385.47 @ Scan \n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 11 Home Retail - USB 64-bit](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/hMYmP6/microsoft-windows-11-home-retail-usb-64-bit-haj-00108) | \u00a3115.00 @ Amazon UK \n**Custom** | [Thermalright TL-C14C X3 CPU Case Fan 140mm, PWM Fan Silent Computer CPU Fan with 1500RPM Speed, CPU Cooling Black Fan,3 Quantities](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/3qNscf/placeholder) | \u00a315.00 @ Amazon UK \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **\u00a32325.28**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2026-01-23 18:50 GMT+0000 |"

        "completion": "Prebuilts are at a very good price level rn so I can see why it's tempting. Their prices are slower to react to the market as their PCs are, well, prebuilts! If you don't want to bother building it, I don't blame you at this moment.\n\nStill, part of the building is the experience. Regardless of your opinion on the actual building itself, it's obvious that doing it yourself, in terms of software and hardware, will force you to familiarize yourself with the system.\n\nYou'll know where cables go and what they look like. You'll understand how to reseat and reinstall components. You'll know how to mess with Bios. You'll be able to reinstall/repair windows and how to setup drivers. That's something you'll never get with a prebuilt.\n\nUltimately, it's about the hobby. If you'd rather let a technician handle your PC like you would a car, then yeah prebuilts and their warranty are a great choice. But if you're the kind of person to change their own oil in their car, I think you'll prefer learning all of this now. Just make sure to build it and stress test it before the return window for your parts expire as RMA is more annoying. \n\nYour decision! Hope this helps."

Something that's serviceable as a base, but over the next months/years I can upgrade into a beast. Starting budget is \\~$1100, but I would like this to be like an infinity bottle of whiskey, where I just keep adding to it.\n\nI do a mix of gaming and photo editing. Game wise, EU5, Minecraft, Noita, have been my goto lately. And for photoeditting I'm usually working with hundreds of raw photos at a time, where ram and CPU are a must. \n\nThe more drives I can have the better, I only need small SSD at the start.\n\nRam, I'd love to be able to put a to of ram in eventually. I have 32gb in my current machine, and max that out regularly. \n\nI have mouse, keyboard, monitor, so skip those.\u200b",
        "completion": "Decent starting machine. You can get a better GPU like the 9060 xt 16gb or the 5060 ti 16gb if you take away half the RAM. Be aware of crazy RAM and storage prices right now.\n\n\nAM5 system. Current CPU is a 6 core but you can get up to 16 core CPUs on this platform. And obviously many more potential upgrades to come in the future. 4 slots for RAM on the Motherboard for easy expansion to 64gb or more. A few m.2 slots for greater future storage expansion.\n\n\nB580 isn't as strong as the 9060 xt 8gb or 5060 ti 8gb for similar prices, but the higher VRAM, digital art work that you do, and games that you play would benefit more from the higher VRAM. I would go for it, but either one of the aforementioned GPUs would work well at the budget if your OK with a low VRAM count.\n\n\nUnfortunately the market dictates that if you want to build a system at a budget like this for what you want, some sacrifices need to be made. I sacrificed storage space and quality of the drive for a decent GPU and 32gb of fast Memory. Maybe you can switch stuff around depending on your priorities. This is just what I would go for at your budget. RAM prices are likely to climb, as well as GPU prices. Storage space can be offset with going with the old fashion HDDs, which seem to have stable pricing. But have the obvious speed and reliability issues if you get a low quality one.\n\n\nCase comes with a 650w PSU included and 3 PWM ARGB fans. Great value there. Cooler is also decent but if you want to get a better one for a future CPU upgrade then you may break the budget a bit.\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/446pjn)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 7600X 4.7 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/66C48d/amd-ryzen-5-7600x-47-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000593wof) | $176.99 @ Amazon\u00a0\n**CPU Cooler** | [ID-COOLING SE-214-XT ARGB 68.2 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Zr8bt6/id-cooling-se-214-xt-argb-682-cfm-cpu-cooler-se-214-xt-argb) | $16.19 @ Amazon\u00a0\n**Motherboard** | [Gigabyte B650M GAMING PLUS WIFI Micro ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9HTZxr/gigabyte-b650m-gaming-plus-wifi-micro-atx-am5-motherboard-b650m-gaming-plus-wf) | $109.95 @ Amazon\u00a0\n**Memory** | [Patriot Viper Elite 5 16 GB (1 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/G79nTW/patriot-viper-elite-5-16-gb-1-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-veb516g6030w) | $169.99 @ Newegg\u00a0\n**Memory** | [Patriot Viper Elite 5 16 GB (1 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/G79nTW/patriot-viper-elite-5-16-gb-1-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-veb516g6030w) | $169.99 @ Newegg\u00a0\n**Storage** | [Western Digital Blue SN580 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/rqhv6h/western-digital-blue-sn580-1-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-wds100t3b0e) | $67.99 @ SanDisk\u00a0\n**Video Card** | [ASRock Challenger OC Arc B580 12 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bYcBD3/asrock-challenger-oc-arc-b580-12-gb-video-card-b580-cl-12go) | $289.99 @ Amazon\u00a0\n**Case** | [Rosewill FBM-X3 MicroATX Mid Tower Case w/650 W Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/pGJBD3/rosewill-fbm-x3-microatx-mid-tower-case-w650-w-power-supply-fbm-x3-650-g) | $89.99 @ Newegg\u00a0\n\u00a0| *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n\u00a0| **Total** | **$1091.08**\n\u00a0| Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2026-01-22 20:06 EST-0500 |"

I think I'm probably wanting to be around the $1000 range but can go a little higher if needed. I've really been considering prebuilts as I just don't know much about which parts work with each other. I was considering Microcenter's Powerspec G527 but wanted to get some more opinions and see if I could get anything nicer for cheaper. I'm near a Microcenter btw.\n\nI haven't really played games much in the past 8 years, but I would imagine I want a PC that could handle Arc Raiders and modded MC at decent quality and frames. Currently play unmodded MC on a Dell Latitude 2-in-1 that I got from work for free, and it just can't handle much at all. Not really sure what games I would play, as I've been pretty limited by hardware thus far so I haven't really explored much.\n\nAfter looking around r/prebuilts and here for a couple days, I think I would want some AMD CPU with a x3d at the end, apparently those are best? Definitely want 32g of RAM, and a very good graphics card. 1 TB SSD would probably be fine to start. My primary requirement would be something that can be upgraded piece by piece as-needed over the years, so I would want a large case right? Not sure. I've heard 4k is only for $3k+ builds, but don't know much beyond that. No clue what the difference is between 1080 and 1440 is in terms of price/experience. Currently using two old 27\" Viewsonic monitors, I know they're probably crap but they were free from my company. Would probably upgrade to nicer 140hz monitors later on. Already have a Logitech MX Master 3s and a Logitech K780 so peripherals are covered.\n\nBonus points if there is a way to disconnect the monitors from the PC easily, as I would like to be able to plug my work laptop in and use both screens daily. Is that a thing or would it just be a cheap docking station?\n\nAnyone have any recs?",

I would mainly use it for games like Red Dead Redemption II or Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p, and I'll do some 3D on Blender as well as using software like After Effects.\n\nI don't have much knowledge of PC building, so I'm looking for help to tell me if my build is okay and if those parts are compatible with each other. After doing research on their different prices, this is what I came up with for around 1200\u20ac in France (only the CPU and GPU will be second-hand).\n\n* CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* CPU Cooler : Thermalright Assassin Spirit 120 EVO Dark\n* Motherboard : MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi\n* Memory : Kingston FURY Beast RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\n* Storage : Patriot Memory P400 Lite M.2 1 To PCI Express 4.0 NVMe \n* Video Card : Palit Dual Geforce RTX 4070 (not sure about this one because I'm looking for a used 4070 or 5070 so it might change depending on price)\n* Power Supply : Cooler Master MWE Gold 650 650 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n\nThe only thing I have no clue about yet is the case. I know I want it to be around 60-80\u20ac. I don't know how to choose one, and if my build is okay, could you recommend me a case that would fit this? Thank you!",

Shouldn't be that much more expensive and it'll keep temps and noise low compared to a basic single tower cooler."

        "prompt": "help me build a well-balanced PC\n\nHello all!\n\nI\u2019m planning to build a PC and I\u2019d like to get some outside opinions before I commit, keep in mind that I\u2019m a beginner and don\u2019t really know much about the topic. I\u2019m open to any suggestions.\n\nThe main idea is to have one solid machine for learning and side projects. I want to try things like local AI experiments (nothing serious, I have only basic youtube theoritical knowledge and dabbled a bit in GPT agents so it\u2019s going to be entry lvl stuff, but I want to explore it), game development (also no practical knowledge, I\u2019m aiming to start with 2D, maybe some basic 3D later), hobby video editing of travel footage (I have a few hours of personal travels recorded that I wanted to make into short vlogs/documentaries), and audio mixing and mastering (mainly heavy vocal processing chains). I already have a few years of experience with audio and I might come back to it more seriously. I\u2019d like to play some games on it as well, but it\u2019s not the main purpose of it. (It\u2019d be nice if I could play Witcher 4 on at least medium details on it)\n\nThis PC is meant to help me learn new skills and possibly earn some side income in the future. It does not have to be a top tier gaming monster, just something well balanced and future proof enough.\n\nMy budget is around 6.5 to 7k PLN (1.8k USD - 1.950 USD) max.\n\nRight now I\u2019m considering a few CPU + GPU combos and I\u2019m not sure which one makes the most sense overall. Note that I was doing my research before the RAM price spikes so I\u2019m not even sure if they still fall into my price range :\n\n\t\u2022\tRyzen 7 7800X3D + RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB\n\n\t\u2022\tRyzen 7 7700 + RTX 5070 12 GB\n\n\t\u2022\tRyzen 9 7900 + a cheaper GPU\n\nOther than that I was thinking some B650 motherboard, some 750W PS based on the safe PS list I have saved somewhere in the bookmarks, some cheap 2x16GB RAM DDR5 with CL in the low 30s, not really sure about the case and cooling.\n\nSome important notes:\n\n\t\u2022\t32 GB RAM is my target for comfort, but I might start with 1x16 GB if it turns out to be too expensive, and add another stick a month later\n\n\t\u2022\tVRAM matters to me because of AI testing and larger video timelines, so 16 GB on the GPU feels very appealing even if raw GPU power is a bit lower, however, I have no idea if that\u2019s the correct way of thinking \n\nDo any of the setups make any sense? If you think any different combination would be a better fit, please let me know! I\u2019d really appreciate a short explanation based on real use cases, not just benchmarks. \n\nThanks a lot.",
        "completion": "I would say the 7700 as you seem to be more geared towards productivity than gaming so avoid the 7800x3d.\n\nThe 5070 has significantly faster raw performance despite having less VRAM. If you are planning to run VRAM heavy tasks like LLM's or SDXL workflows then the 5060ti with 16gb VRAM is a better bet but if you are running smaller models that you expect to fit within 12gb VRAM then go with 5070.\n\nIf you do decide to go with the 5060ti 16gb, you may have budget to increase CPU to 9700.\n\nPhanteks XT PRO Ultra is a good case and comes with 4 pre installed fans.\n\nThermalright Peerless Assassin / Phantom Spirit is a solid CPU cooler."

My idea is to build it around a RTX5080, with a 2TB SSD and RAM between 64-96 GB (based on your recommendations). My price range would be around 3500 euros (can go up to 4000 if it's justifiable). No need for peripherals. Lastly, I've been out of the PC market for a long time, so any extra recommendations will be appreciated based on my game dev purpose. Thanks!",

Currently gaming on a macbook pro 2019, so that's the extent of games I'm playing. CS2, Rocket League, Fortnite, and maybe pick up some newer FPS, but on relatively low settings while streaming. I've never touched 144hz in my life so looking for that maybe 280hz if possible. \n\n  \nBudget around $1500-1700 not including monitor. Appreciate any suggestions.",

The RAM market sucks right now but we need 32 GB so it is what it is.\n\n- SSD - 1 TB of fast Gen 4 NVMe SSD storage. High read/write speeds and a DRAM cache.\n\n- GPU - the RTX 5060 is a good fit for your needs. NVIDIA is a must for anything AI, including Topaz, but Photoshop doesn't really rely that much on the GPU. It only cares whether we have a GPU or not.\n\n- Case - good value for the price, with good airflow thanks to the mesh front panel and 3 included fans. Dual chamber for easy installation and cable management.\n\n- PSU - good quality for the price, 650W is more than this system needs but it was the same price as comparable 500-600W units.\n\nLet me know what you think :)"
